## Description

A user should be view a list of any of several windows provided with the site. The user may navigate to a page containing an iframe for that site. They should should be able to suggest a tag for that piece of content. If you use an admin/user upload feature you may add several categories to your content from a predetermined list, and you should be able to manually write in extra tags (like a category, but not significant enough to be on the list) for your piece of content. A user should be able to filter content on display by category, or search by key words to only display content with those in its title and/or tags.

## Setup and Installation
Here are some links in case you need information about setup for other operating systems:  
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/);

(If you cannot install node you still need to install Git's [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your device)

## Component Structure

![alt text](src/assets/component-tree.png)

## Project Proposal:

#### Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:
Allow users to choose from a list of React Component/ flash games to play

#### List of the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* display a list of available games
unique routes for each
* have requirement form to upload new flash game/ Game component

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will I use to create this MVP?

* react
* react-router
* at least one pure logic third party component that contains a playable game (no dependencies for testing purposes)
search feature to find specific games (by name)

#### If I finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will I work on next?

* add ability to play flash games
* include dependancies for component games (component libraries)
* add categories: I the site host, and the game uploader may add categories to a game - keywords for searching so others may find the game that fits what they are looking for more easily (set hard limit). i.e. 'platformer' or 'adventure' (a common genre)
* add tags: users may suggest 'tags' for a game, so that a game may adopt more search terms to be associated with a game. i.e. 'metroidvania' (a popular description made up by a gaming community)

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* flash loader
* mp3 file loader
* Materialize - for additional design
* either a pluggin loader, or links to deployed sites (loaded within an i-frame)

#### Other things I'd like you to know:

MVP will use a Component with no additional libraries to be loaded (I'll just refactor the intro group week project into a single component over the weekend - minimal work necessary). I haven't messed with flash before, from what I've heard it probably isn't to hard to implement. I'll focus on hitting MVP then UI/UX design, then adding additional features.
